Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use differ sampling and scaling technique for analysis the dataset with Machine learning models like LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost,Neural Network, hybrid model like LG + XG+ CAT, LG + XG, LG + CAT, XG  + CAT which got 98% of accuracy as per author, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Stacking Classifier with RF + LightGBM With Gradient Boosting which got 100% accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
